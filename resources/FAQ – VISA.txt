International students are required to undergo a health screening and obtain a visa before studying abroad.

Once the health screening is completed, the student can proceed with the visa application process.

Whether you need an entry visa to Malaysia depends on your nationality and the purpose of your visit. Malaysia offers different types of visas, including single-entry and multiple-entry visas, and the specific requirements can vary based on your country of citizenship.

To determine whether you need a single-entry visa, it is essential to check the latest visa requirements and application procedures with the Malaysian Embassy or Consulate in your home country. Visa requirements can change, and they may vary depending on your nationality and the specific circumstances of your visit. Make sure to provide accurate and complete documentation when applying for a visa to avoid any issues with your entry into Malaysia.

ii.	The Visa Approval Letter issued by the Immigration Department of Malaysia
iii.	All other relevant documents and forms duly completed
iv.	Payment as outlined by the Malaysian Embassy for the application of an entry visa.



15.	How long will it take me to get a Visa Approval Letter (VAL)?

It should take 14 working days upon receipt of a complete application and payment. Since the Visa Approval Letter (VAL) is issued by the Immigration Department, the 14 working days are at the discretion of the Immigration Department.




16.	How long does it take to get an entry visa from Malaysian Embassy?

This depends upon the Malaysian Embassy in your home country. However, it typically does not take more than 3 working days.





17.	My Visa Approval Letter has expired, and I did not come to Malaysia. Now I want to come and study. What should I do?

It is mandatory for all international students to enter Malaysia before the expiry of the VAL since the VAL is issued with six (6) months validity, which is sufficient for international students to enter the country. Even if you have obtained a valid Single-Entry Visa (SEV) but entered Malaysia after the expiry date of the VAL, the Malaysian Immigration Department may not proceed with the student pass endorsement.

In the situation that your VAL has expired, the Immigration Department will not extend the validity of the VAL. As such, you are required to apply for a new VAL prior to your entry into Malaysia. Kindly contact your institution to cancel the expired VAL and request EMGS to close the current application and submit a new application for VAL.


18.	When do I get student pass/ sticker endorsed into my passport?

Once you arrive in Malaysia, you will be required to attend post arrival medical screening within 7 days. Your institution will accept your passport for the purpose of arranging for the student pass/sticker endorsement. From the day your passport is submitted at our front desk, the process should take 14 working days. Please note that this timeline is at the discretion of the Immigration Department.




19.	Can I study on my social visit pass/ tourist visa?

No, this is not permitted. International students are only permitted to study full time courses in Malaysia with a valid student pass issued by the Immigration Department.

If you enter Malaysia with a social pass, you will be asked to exit Malaysia and re-enter with a Visa Approval Letter.




20.	Can I stay in Malaysia after performing my Pre-VAL Medical Screening in Malaysia?

It is not recommended for you to stay in Malaysia under a Social Pass while you are waiting for your Visa Approval Letter. This may cause delays in your Visa processing.


21.	I am not on social pass. Can I be given a special pass once my social pass expires during my VAL application?

It is not recommended for students to be in Malaysia on a Social Pass during the VAL application process. If your social pass expires while you are in Malaysia, EMGS cannot process a special pass for you. We can only process a Special Pass for students if their Student Pass expires.

If you are on a Social Pass and are planning to obtain a Student Pass, you will be asked to exit Malaysia once your Visa Approval Letter is issued. You can then re-enter Malaysia with your Visa Approval Letter and Single Entry Visa (if an SEV is required for your country).
